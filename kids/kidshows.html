    As you know, raising a kid is no walk in the park. On top of financing these little demon's choices, now you have a
    little copies of yourself running intentionally into sharp furniture corners. So, what is the solution, you may ask?
    Making them watch movies that not only mature them, but keep them entertained for hours on end! Here is my top 5
    movies to show kids so that they can learn about aspects of the real world starting from a young age.

    We start this list off with a cult classic, Saw. From the complex mechanisms of each trap to themes of moral
    wrongdoings and punishment, this movie will not only allow your kid to expand their creative space and make
    intruiging, complicated traps at home, but they will also learn the values of having good morals and not fucking up,
    or else they will get punished.

    We continue this list strong with another movie classic. This movie, although on the dramatic side, is a great
    movie to show a child who you want to become a doctor. The scenes with extreme body disfigurement will not only
    catch the attention of any premed child, but will allow them to diagnose any of the creatures with any issues they
    have.

    If your child has even a slight interest in being a stockbroker, not only is this movie perfect for them, it's
    perfect for them. This gives a great representation of the financial potential that your child can achieve and
    details this process step by step so that your child, too, can become <del>a successful criminal</del> extremely
    rich.

    Number 2 is our first cartoon movie on this list. This movie details the lives of groceries and how food at
    supermarkets interact and make friends. If your kid is struggling to make friends, this is definitely the go-to
    movie to show how if nonsentient objects can make friends, so can your kid. The ending scene is, in my opinion,
    the scene that will change your kid's life. Make sure they watch the last 10 minutes of the film.

    Ah, Shrek, the undisputed number 1 choice movie for your kid or honestly anyone. This movie has it all: suspense,
    action, comedy, and most importantly, ogres falling in love with human-ogres. Does this movie have memorable
    characters? Yes. Will this movie leave your child in tears of joy? Absolutely. Is your child going to grow up with
    an attraction to big, green swamp monsters? 100%. This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie to show your kid
    if you want them to grow up healthy, strong, and smart. #iloveshrekromantically
