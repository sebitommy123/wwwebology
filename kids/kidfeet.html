  <p class="showtext">I will start by saying I think kids are useless. They are emotional manipulators that cry to get
    what they want, they don't pay taxes, can't get jobs, and contribute nothing to society. The only thing they are
    good for is occassionally having good feet, so here are some images of feet and how I would rank them according to
  </p>
  <center><ol class="showtext">
    <li>softness</li>
    <li>plumpness of toes</li>
    <li>how much I would want to tickle their feet</li>
  </ol></center>

  <center><ul class="showtext" id="ranking1">
    <li>Softness: 3/10</li>
    <li>Plumpness: 2/10</li>
    <li>Tickle meter: 9/10</li>
  </ul></center>
  <p class="showtext" id="desc1">Overall pretty bad feet. They're only getting plus points because of how spread out the
    toes are. Grippers. I want to put my fingers between those toes. Or my toes between those toes. Anyway, wrinkly
    feet, no fat, and weirdly shaped. Some of them are square shaped and the second to left one is so disturbingly
    pointy. 3/10.</p>

    height="350px"></center>
  <center><ul class="showtext" id="ranking2">
    <li>Softness: 6/10</li>
    <li>Plumpness: 5/10</li>
    <li>Tickle meter: 4/10</li>
  </ul></center>
  <p class="showtext" id="desc2">Meh. I'm disturbed by the fact that I can see the veins. And the toenails are so badly
    shaped. Why is the big toenail so wide. Why are all the left toes so scattered. Where is the foot fat. Plus points
    because the big toe is so plump. 5/10.</p>

  <center><ul class="showtext" id="ranking3">
    <li>Softness: 8.5/10</li>
    <li>Plumpness: 9/10</li>
    <li>Tickle meter: 9/10</li>
  </ul></center>
  <p class="showtext" id="desc3">Simply wow. My day is better. My week is better. My year is better. I am feeling patriotic.
    My toes are curling. I want to pinch every toe. You can't even differentiate the heel from the rest of the leg. The
    toes are squished against the rest of the foot. Wow. 9/10.</p>
