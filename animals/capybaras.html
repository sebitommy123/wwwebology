                <h3>Big Baller Bapybaras</h3>
                  <img class="bodyimg" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/f2/b7/82/f2b7825f567bba69e6b396b2ac062f91.jpg" alt="ballers">
                <p>Capybaras are the largest of rodents, weighing from 35 to 66 kg and standing up to 0.6
                  meters at the shoulder, with a length of about 1.2 meters. Females of this species are slightly
                  larger than males. Their fur is coarse and thin, and is reddish brown over most of the body,
                  turning yellowish brown on the belly and sometimes black on the face (Frankis et al 2014).
                  The body is barrel-shaped, sturdy, with a vestigial tail. (Frankis et al 2014, Wikipedia 2014).
                  The capybara shows a number of adaptations to a semi- aquatic life. It is able to swim with
                  only the nostrils, eyes and short, rounded ears protruding out of the water, as they are placed
                  high on the head, and the body contains a large amount of fatty tissue, giving it a neutral
                  buoyancy in water (Mones and Ojasti 1986, Nowak 1991). The feet are also partially webbed.
                  Each of the forefeet has four toes, while the hind feet have only three, and each toe bears a
                  strong, hoof-like claw (Nowak 1991, Mones and Ojasti 1986). The front legs are slightly
                  shorter than the hind legs and the capybara often sits on its haunches like a dog, but, unlike
                  many other rodents, is unable to hold food in its forefeet (Nowak 1991, MacDonald 2006).
                  The male capybara can be distinguished from the female by the obvious, highly developed
                  scent gland on top of the snout. This dark, naked, raised area secretes a copious white,
                  sticky fluid, thought to be involved in signalling dominance status (MacDonald 2006, Nowak
                  1991). This species is distinguished from the lesser capybara by its larger size, although
                  there is some confusion over the distributional boundaries of these species (Querolo 2008). </p>
                <h4>Clean Kweens</h4>
                  <img class="bodyimg" src="https://video-images.vice.com/_uncategorized/1635851029473-5omt44gf44gb5rmv44kr44os44ka44op44kz44op.jpeg?resize=1600:*" alt="clean queen">
                <p>Capybaras are very gregarious. They are typically found in groups that average 10â€“20
                  individuals, comprising a dominant male, one or more females (which are often related),
                  young of various ages, and one or more subordinate males (Alho and Rondon 1987, Mones
                  and Ojasti 1986). Capybara groups can consist of as many as 50 or 100 individuals during
                  the dry season, when the animals gather around available water sources (MacDonald 2006).
                  Males are organized in stable, linear hierarchies. The dominant male in each group is
                  significantly heavier than any of the subordinates, but among subordinates, status is not
                  correlated with weight (Herra et al 1993). The most dominant males have access to the best
                  resources (Herra et al 1993).
                  Capybaras are very vocal and, when in groups, chatter with each other to establish social
                  bonds, dominance or general group census (MacDonald 2006). They can make dog-like
                  barks when threatened or when females are herding young (Murphy et al 1985). Capybaras
                  have two different scent glands; a morillo, located on the snout, and an anal gland
                  (MacDonald et al 1984). Both sexes have these glands, but males have much larger morillos
                  and their anal pockets can open more easily. The anal glands of males are also lined with
                  detachable hairs coated with a scent secretion which are released when in contact with
                  objects such as plants. A capybara marks by rubbing its morillo on an object or by walking
                  over a scrub and marking with its anal gland. A capybara can spread its scent further by
                  urinating. Females usually mark without urinating and mark less frequently than males overall
                  (MacDonald et al 1984).
                  Capybaras are agile on land (capable of running as fast as a horse) and are also excellent
                  swimmers. They can remain completely submerged for up to five minutes (Smithsonian Zoo),
                  an ability they use to evade predators. Capybaras can sleep in water if need be, only keeping
                  their noses out of the water. During midday, as temperatures increase, they wallow in water
                  or in mud and then graze in late afternoons and early evenings (Mones and Ojasti 1986).
                  They rest around midnight and then continue to graze before dawn.
                  The species is normally active morning and evening, resting during the heat of the day, but
                  has apparently become nocturnal in areas where it is persecuted by humans (Nowak 1991).</p>

                <p>In the early 2020s, capybaras became a growing figure of meme culture due to many factors, 
                  including as previously mentioned the disturbances in Nordelta
                  which led to them being comically postulated as figures of class struggle,
                  as well the growth of a common meme format which includes capybaras in various
                   situations to the song "After Party" by Don Toliver, leading to a tremendous growth in popularity.
                   Due to a lyric in Toliver's song, capybaras are also associated with the phrase "Ok I pull up".
